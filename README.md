I have learnt in my life that systems based on "Primacy" are more effective than systems based on "Balance". This is because balance is largely based on subjective feelings that are hard to gage and you can only take action when you are 'out of balance'. Primacy-based systems help with taking action sooner while creating a hierachy of values.

I discovered Rand's primacy-based model for life which starts at survival and then continued to being productive as a human value.

I supplemented the list with "thrive" as the other side of the coin to "survive", but included examples from Peikoff about what that could mean.

I then added some Peterson-esque element of "things to stop doing" and gave an example from Peikoff about what those might be. Then instead of focusing on a negative, I added a column to focus on what to value and what action to take in a positive way.

People have so far reacted well to the list, so I included it here.
