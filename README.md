I have learnt in my life that systems based on "Primacy" are more effective than systems based on "Balanced"

I discovered Rand's primacy-based model for life which starts at survival and then continued to being productive as a human value.

I supplemented the list with "thrive" as the other side of the coin to "survive", but included examples from Peikoff about what that could mean.

I then added some Peterson-esque element of "things to stop doing" and gave an example from Peikoff about what those might be. Then instead of focusing on a negative, I added a column to focus what to value or what action to take in a positive way.

People have so far reacted well to the list, so I included it here.
