The ToDo list is based on a few philosophies and has quite a bit of thought and experience put into it.
Here is an explanation about them:


Objectivism: 
- Primacy based systems vs Balance (Golden mean) based systems. Aristotle's balanced systems is something that I have found deeply lacking. Those systems do not encourage directed action very well, because its largely based on subjective feelings and only when you 'feel' you are out of balance. Rand identified Primacy based systems (primary, secondary..) and I agree that they are more correct and more straight forward and are easier to take action on - it is just that they are harder to make. I would add that I find it lazy when people take two different (but not opposing) concepts to describe reality that sound good and then slap a name of a system on it that just needs 'balance' between the two different concepts. 
- Rand identified that philosophically, survival is our most important value and that all other values try to accomplish that main value. This is similar to biology and creatures in nature.
- Rand also identified that humans value producing value for other people and their community. 
- Throughout our lives, we make choices based on our values. In 'evolve', it is important to identify which choices
benefit us in the long term. We need to make those decisions rationally (not impulsively and based on evidence) and prioritise which actions to take based on that decision.
- In 'thrive', I added the pursuit of happiness (John Locke). It is also the flip-side of the coin of survive.

Stoicism:
Stoicism has some very useful lessons and approaches to life, unfortunately the core beliefs of the ancient stoics do go against individuality with their ethics of duty and their belief that fate is pre-determined. 
- Stoicism prepares you for whatever life throws at you and this is very helpful with the biological concept of evolving and adapting to change.
- In 'thrive', the question, 'what things would you miss dearly' is a concept from stoicism called 'negative visualisation'. It is a form of gratitude exercise, but in reverse. Oddly enough, it helps you appreciate what you have, want to spend more time with it and you are also more prepared should you actually do lose it.
- In 'waste', we have reversing hedonic adaptation which is proper Stoicism. Not falling into addictive (social) games. We also have 'locus of control' in the context of not wasting your emotional energy on the wrong things.


Philosophy of Systems:
- In 'evolve', I discuss the benefits of systematizing to be more productive.
- Identifying risks for unintended consequences is a concept from systems theory. As in, do not try to make a change to a system that may result in breaking the whole system.

Jordan Peterson
- In 'waste', there is the concept to stop doing something which don't help you. In the first version of the todo list, this was included in this way. This time, I felt that it had to be clearer or people would not use that section, so I included examples from Stoicism. Waste is also a concept in Biology for creatures that seek for resources, but then waste them on less than efficient reasons.

Evolutionary Psychology and Biology
- I tried to make this list echo Biology, because I acknowledge that we are all animals and that those have influences on us as well as we live in a biological world. Luckily, we have creativity and reason and we use those cognitive tools to survive, be productive, evolve and thrive.
