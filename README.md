On version 3.

The ToDo list is based on a few philosophies and has quite a bit of thought and experience put into it.
Here is an explanation about them:


## Objectivism: 
- Primacy based systems vs Balance (Golden mean) based systems. Aristotle's balanced systems is something that I have found deeply lacking. Those systems do not encourage directed action very well, because its largely based on subjective feelings and only when you 'feel' you are out of balance. Rand identified Primacy based systems (primary, secondary..) and I agree that they are more correct and more straight forward and are easier to take action on - it is just that they are harder to make. I would add that I find it lazy when people take two different (but not opposing) concepts to describe reality that sound good and then slap a name of a system on it that just needs 'balance' between the two different concepts. 
- Rand identified that philosophically, survival is our most important value and that all other values try to accomplish that main value. This is similar to biology and creatures in nature.
- Rand also identified that humans value producing value for other people and their community. 
- In 'thrive', I added the pursuit of happiness (John Locke). It is also the flip-side of the coin of survive.

## Theory of Constraints:
- We should identify bottlenecks that slow us down from reaching our goals and we need to be aware of them
- Once we remove them, we can increase our metaphysical efficacy and reach our values faster

## Jordan Peterson
- The 'to stop' part was taken from Peterson. He talks about stop doing things that take you away from your goals and to-do lists don't often have 'to-stop' parts to them and it did seem like a good idea to focus on what not to do as well as what to do.
